## About
This Python subdirectory of the project focuses on implementing and optimizing machine learning algorithms using Python libraries such as NumPy. It uses NumPy to broadcast the filters when processing the images. 

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.10.8
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- torchvision.datasets
- torchvision.transforms
- Logging

## Installation
To get started with the project:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s24-idatt2900-072/parallelization.git && cd parallelization/rust/
```
2. install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib torchvision
```

## Run the Code
To run the main Python script:
```bash
cd python && python src/main.py
```
