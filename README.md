# Overview

This project explores the parallelization of machine learning methods on CPU and GPU platforms, with implementations in Rust and C++. Initially conceived as an investigation into various parallelization strategies across CPU and GPU, including specially designed hardware such as FPGA, the project shifted to primarily focus on the Rust and C++ implementations due to the complexity associated with the hardware systems. The theoretical potential of such hardware, however, continues to be a discussion point in our analysis.

# Objectives

1. **Implementation**: Develop and parallelize machine learning methods suited for image analysis on CPU and GPU using Rust, with a comparative implementation in C++.
2. **Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of these implementations.
3. **Analysis**: Discuss the results from the experiments.
